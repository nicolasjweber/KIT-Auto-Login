# KIT Auto-Login

KIT Auto-Login is a **Firefox** extension that automatically clicks through various KIT login pages for you. It currently supports ILIAS, CAS Campus, and Lecture Translator.
To enable fully automatic login, make sure that Firefox's built-in password manager is set to autofill your username and password.
Fully working as of August 2025.

## Installation

Latest version of the addon can be downloaded [on AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/kit-auto-login/). Additionally, individual releases will be uploaded here on GitHub as well.

## Contributing

You are welcome to make a push request. But if you prefer you can also just fork it, I do not mind at all.
