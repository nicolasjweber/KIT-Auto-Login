# iliasLogin

This is a repository for a **Firefox** addon which clicks you through the KIT ILIAS and CAS Campus login pages automatically. It is meant to be used by students at KIT. You need to have your password saved by the Firefox password manager.

You are welcome to make a push request. But if you prefer you can also just fork it, I do not mind at all.
